Not all of the students will have achieved A’s or B’s in every discipline, though hopefully, they will report to you the positive lessons they’ve learned in every field and the ones they’ve excelled at. They have not only made us proud but brought accolades to our school and have given it a good reputation in our ( geographic region ), thus adding extra feather to its cap.

And it is our responsibility as adults to value sportsmanship and award the courage of students to take action rather than focusing on winning or losing.Our school truly believes that good education plays a vital role in building a bright future for our children.

      Today, quizzes are interactive platforms where students are not participating to take home a prize or get famous overnight, but to gain knowledge, seek opportunities to excel beyond.Since questions are based out-of-syllabus and require critical thinking and extensive research, students get into the habit of innovative learning from an early age. Students need to form teams while participating in quizzes, giving them an opportunity to hone their teamwork skills.During interviews, recruiters have found that Indian students are good in theoretical knowledge but are not privy to industry knowledge because of the current pattern of curriculum. Hence, there is still a huge gap in preparing our students for the market.
